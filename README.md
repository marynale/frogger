#Introduction The project was submitted for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program. The goal of the project was to complete the creation of a classic arcade game (frogger) by adding proper methods and functions to the javascript and images that were provided.

#Start the game Download the code by selecting 'Download ZIP'. Then simply open index.html in the browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).

#About the game The game is set in a place made up of a grassy section, a stone section, and a water section. The enemies are bugs who walk through stone section, which divides the grassy section from the water section. The player controls a character and tries to safely cross the stone section to reach the water, without hitting any bugs. The goal of the game is to reach the water. A round ends when the player hits into a bug. There is no end time to the game. You can play as long as you want to.

#Rules The player must reach the water without hitting into a bug. If the player is successful he can continue the game. If he hits a bug the round ends. The player is then moved back to the start position.

#Game instructions To move the player use the arrow keys. Left arrow: player goes left Right arrow: player goes right Up arrow: player goes up Down arrow: player goes down.
